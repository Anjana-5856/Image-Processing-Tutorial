An image is a 2D function f(x,y), where x and y are spatial co-ordinates and the amplitude of f at any pair of co-ordinates(x,y) is called the intensity  or gray level of the image at that point.
Machines see any images in the form of a matrix of numbers.The size of the this matrix actually depends on the number of pixels of the input image.

Grayscale Image

The grey level or grey value indicates the brightness of a pixel. The minimum grey level is 0. The maximum grey level depends on the digitisation depth of the image. In contrast, in a greyscale or colour image a pixel can take on any value between 0 and 255.Grayscale is a range of monochromatic shades from black to white.

Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light.Contrast is an important factor in any subjective evaluation of image quality. Contrast is created by the difference in luminance reflected from two adjacent surfaces. In other words, contrast is the difference in visual properties that makes an object distinguishable from other objects and the background.

Histogram Equalization is a computer image processing technique used to improve contrast in image. This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable data is represented by close contrast values. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast.
