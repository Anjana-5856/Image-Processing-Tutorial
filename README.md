# Image-Processing-Tutorial
An image is a 2D function f(x,y), where x and y are spatial co-ordinates and the amplitude of f at any pair of co-ordinates(x,y) is called the intensity  or gray level of the image at that point.
Machines see any images in the form of a matrix of numbers.The size of the this matrix actually depends on the number of pixels of the input image.

Grayscale Image

The grey level or grey value indicates the brightness of a pixel. The minimum grey level is 0. The maximum grey level depends on the digitisation depth of the image. In contrast, in a greyscale or colour image a pixel can take on any value between 0 and 255.Grayscale is a range of monochromatic shades from black to white.
